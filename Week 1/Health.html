                &#128138;<b>Milk and Bone Health:</b>
                Milk is loaded with calcuim which is essential for building strong bones as well as healthy teeth.
                <br><br>
                &#128138;<b>Milk and Muscle Strength:</b>
                One glass of milk holds around 8 grams of protein. Protein is essential for muscle growth and development. Whey protein powder actually comes from milk.
                <br><br>
                &#128138;<b>Prevents Weight Gain:</b>
                The high protein in milk makes people feel fuller, so they won't eat as much. Milk also has acids in it the help with boosting weight loss.
                <br><br>
                &#128138;<b>Packed with vitamins and minerals:</b>
                Besides having the commonly associated health benefits (Calcium and protein), milk is full of other important vitamins and minerals. Some of these include fat, vitamin D, B2, B12, Potassium, Phosphorus, vitamin A, magnesium, zinc, thiamine, and Selenium. Milk is also full of several types of healthy acids.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <p> These health benefits can be further extended when milk is flavored. For example, strawberry milk when used with real fruit can provide you with vitamin C, fiber, and several antioxidants on top of what milk already provides.
                 Chocolate milk can provide an extra boost of protien, lower your blood pressure and help prevent heart disease. Milk combined with other healthy foods can be a delicous way to eat healthy.
