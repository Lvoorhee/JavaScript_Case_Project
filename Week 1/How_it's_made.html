            <p>Before it can be sold milk has to undergo a few processes before it goes out to the shelves. These processes are called pasteurization and homogenization

                First we will talk about the process of pasteurization. Pasteurization is when milk is heated up and quickly cooled back down in order to kill any harmful bacteria that may be in the raw milk.

                Next stop, homogenization. Homogenization is the process of breaking down the fat on the top layer of the raw mild and distributing it througout the milk. Homogenization is what gives milk it's 
                creamy taste and color. Homogenization is also where different percentages come from when you buy milk. Before homogenization, people would just shake up the bottle to distribute the fat throughout.
